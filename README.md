## Installation Guide

**Important:**  *Installing QVitaOS, a modified operating system, involves inherent risks. **Always back up all your important data before proceeding.** Carefully follow these instructions to ensure a smooth and safe installation process.*

1.  **Download the QVitaOS ISO:**
    *   Obtain the official QVitaOS ISO file exclusively from [Link to your official download source - e.g., GitHub Releases, SourceForge, official website].
    *   **Crucially, verify the ISO checksum (SHA256) after downloading to guarantee file integrity and security.** [Provide the SHA256 checksum value for your latest ISO release and clear instructions on how users can verify it using tools like `CertUtil -hashfile QVitaOS_edition.iso SHA256` on Windows or `shasum -a 256 QVitaOS_edition.iso` on Linux/macOS].
2.  **Create Bootable USB Drive:**
    *   Utilize a reputable tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (recommended for Windows) or [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) (multi-boot USB solution) to create a bootable USB drive from the downloaded QVitaOS ISO.  **Ensure you select the correct USB drive and use the recommended settings within Rufus/Ventoy (e.g., GPT partition scheme for UEFI, or MBR for Legacy BIOS if required).**
3.  **Boot from USB:**
    *   Power off your computer completely.  Power it back on and **immediately access your BIOS/UEFI boot menu.** This is typically done by pressing keys like `Delete`, `F2`, `F12`, `Esc`, or `F11` during startup (refer to your motherboard manual for the correct key).
    *   **Select your USB drive from the boot menu** to initiate the QVitaOS installation process.
4.  **Follow the QVitaOS Setup:**
    *   The QVitaOS Setup will launch. Carefully follow the on-screen prompts to install QVitaOS.
    *   **[Specify any specific steps or options users should pay close attention to during installation, if any. For example: "During the 'Disk Partitioning' step, choose 'Custom Installation' if you want to create partitions manually, or 'Express Install' to let the installer handle partitioning automatically (on a blank drive)."]**
    *   **[If there are options to select specific components or features during installation, clearly document those choices here.]**
5.  **Complete Installation and First Boot:**
    *   Once the installation process is finished, your system will automatically restart and boot into your newly installed QVitaOS.  **The first boot may take slightly longer as the system finalizes setup.**

## Post-Installation Tips

*   **Driver Installation is Essential:**  Immediately after booting into QVitaOS, **install the latest drivers for all your hardware components directly from the respective manufacturers' websites (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, motherboard manufacturer, etc.).** This ensures optimal performance and stability.
*   **Windows Update Considerations:**  QVitaOS is designed to minimize bloat, but **it's still crucial to periodically check for and install Windows Security Updates.** These updates are vital for system security. [Specify if you have any recommendations regarding update settings in QVitaOS].
*   **Explore QVitaOS Customizations:** Take time to explore the pre-configured customizations and any included tools within QVitaOS.  **Refer to [link to separate QVitaOS customization guide or documentation, if you have one] for detailed information on available options.**
